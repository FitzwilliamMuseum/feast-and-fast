The fifteenth-century San Francesco  
passionately dislikes Tesco.  
When he became a monk he swore  
that he’d be good and pure and poor  
but as he touched the Holy Book  
its sheepskin cover cringed and shook  
until he swore he wouldn’t cook  
with animal ingredients.

Devils tested his obedience:  
every morning he’d awaken  
from a dream of eggs and bacon  
sizzling on the kitchen fires  
but his group of Minim friars  
porridge-mindedly ignored it.  
The saint’s devotion was rewarded  
when priests had baked his favourite trout  
and Jesus heard his anguished shout.  
The zombie fish leapt splashing thither  
verily merrily down the river.

Every Sunday, San Francesco  
checks the frozen fish in Tesco.  
A lively lamb trips at his heels,  
skipping around the trolley wheels.  
Last week, as he asked the cost  
of cod, his little lamb got lost.  
Today he paced the supermarket  
swirling in a cloak so dark it  
filled the aisles with melancholy,  
stopping every shopping trolley:  
Have you seen my Martinello?  
His curls are black, his eyes are yellow?  
Guards came to escort him out.  
Francesco stared at them in doubt  
then clapped his holy hands—unflummoxed,  
his lamb sprang nimbly from their stomachs.
