I will act on my food.  
Eyeing it, spying it.  
To sniff, whiff, and kiss aromas;  
The old nose factory at work.  
Then I’ll touch with a finger, or 
Press with a fork.  
Sensing resistance, persistence until 
A giving softness allows me to puncture and lift  
To my mouth where saliva,  
Rushes in, ushers it to tongue and teeth.   
My cheeks catch it like a trumpeter catching air.   
Then it’s gone, to turn to chime  
And on and on and down, then out.
