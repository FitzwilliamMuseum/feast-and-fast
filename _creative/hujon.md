that one hind leg caught in a snare  
hampering his leap back to freedom  
splayed against a tree trunk  
he could only wait   
for life to slip away   
as the dying sun’s rays   
warmed his belly   
turning soft white into mild gold  
his amber eyes open  
gazing into a place he knew  
until even that faded into blank  
beside him a pheasant   
his dead weight soon to be stripped of its heraldic colours  
eyes lidded over in resignation  
a split second after a bullet made sure   
no time was left for memories and regret
 
they call this tableau   
Dead Game and Fruit  
but what a manifesto   
for the vigour and textures of being alive   
for you to curl your tongue  
around the sweetness of a grape  
to fill the hollow of your palm   
with the weight of a peach  
before sinking your teeth   
into its yielding flesh   
truly a land of light and plenty  
over whose shoulder   
watch yellowing uneasy skies
