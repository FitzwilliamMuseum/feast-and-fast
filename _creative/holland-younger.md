Oily snow clings to roofs;
Perused by two ducks, flying high
Above a frozen river which
Unites the banks of a village.

Birds; black dots, bent-beaked shadows
Perch on snow-blanched branches,
The bark-gloved fingers 
Of the sleeping trees.  

The villagers play on the winter ice
And secretly entice the birds
To gather, perch and feed
Beneath an old wooden door.

Hunger’s companions, the red-breasted birds
peck at a shadow of food on the snow.
They flatter the winter with their plumage,
Ignored by all. 

A prop elevates the Damaclean door above them.
Frozen like the picture, the dead-fall in
Perpetual abeyance allows their fire to burn in the cold.
