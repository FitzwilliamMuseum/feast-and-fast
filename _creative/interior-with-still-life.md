I left my eye on top of the sideboard.  
It had no complaints. It wanted a   
breather. It wanted to flip out, flop  
free, cut loose from the grip of my   
co-dependent lashes, my socket’s  
strictures and crap about keeping   
up appearances. Screw all that! it   
breathed, basking on tissue paper.   
If it were a dog it might have rolled   
over, but it didn’t bother. Blissed   
out in that posture. Disposed to not  
take in what was on offer:   
wonky mirror, ceiling crack,   
portion of a picnic by Cezanne.
