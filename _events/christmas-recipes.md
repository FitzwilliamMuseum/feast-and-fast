We are all more than familiar with our Christmas food traditions, such as roast turkey and plum pudding and we rightly assume that these dishes emerged some time in the distant past. But what about the many seasonal treats that history has left behind? Have you ever heard of a Yule Dow, a loaf of bread in the form of the Christ child, placed by children under the altar on Christmas Eve? Or the breakfast hackin, a sweet haggis eaten in England until the early eighteenth century as the first meat meal on Christmas morning after the Advent fast? And what about Christmas Pie, furmety, Yule bread, Bishop and the stunningly decorated Twelfth Cakes consumed at Twelfth Night parties? Join Food Historian, Ivan Day, for this insightful talk with demonstration of original equipment and object handling opportunities. Afterwards there will also be the chance to walk around the Feast & Fast exhibition with Ivan to look at exhibits relating to Christmas food traditions.
