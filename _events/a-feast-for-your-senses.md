See our new Feast & Fast exhibition, join pop-up talks, learn more about Christmas food traditions and book for a special screening of Bright Star (PG) – a romantic drama about John Keats (starring Ben Whishaw), which charts his three-year romance with Fanny Brawne near the end of his life. Programmed to complement our Keats display and accompanied by live music.

Catch up on your Christmas shopping with cards, decorations and unique art inspired gifts and jewellery in the Courtyard Shop and relax with seasonal treats in the Courtyard Café to live jazz music.
