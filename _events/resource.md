Design a feast that looks as good as it tastes with artist Caroline Wendling. Let your imagination run riot and create your own fanciful food displays that we can eat with our eyes, gaining design inspiration from the Baroque table displays in our Feast & Fast exhibition.

BOOKING ESSENTIAL. To register your interest please tel: 01223 332904 or email: education@fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk. Places will be confirmed on receipt of payment.
