Thursday 20 and Friday 21 February 2020

The pineapple is an emblem of power, promise and politics and continues to attract interest from plant scientists, historians and artists. From its ‘discovery’ by European colonisers in the late 15th century to an everyday canned food and logo of fair trade movements, it is a story through which we can understand modern globalisation.

This interdisciplinary conference brings together academics from the arts, humanities, social sciences and sciences as well as museum professionals and artist-practitioners. They will investigate the understudied tensions between the representational power of the pineapple and the political contexts of its production around the globe.

This conference builds on some of the themes from the Fitzwilliam’s Feast & Fast exhibition, while making connections between the global and local origins of the food that we eat which are at the heart of contemporary debates.
