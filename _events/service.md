A talk with Prof Deborah Krohn, Bard Graduate Center, New York.

This talk will explore several cookbooks, many of them illustrated, published in several European languages between around 1550 and 1800. Texts providing instruction on the preparation and serving of food proliferated, along with printed books of all sorts. Many of these books are on view in the current exhibition, Feast and Fast.

Admission is by token, one per person, available at the Courtyard Entrance desk on a first-come first-served basis 30 minutes before the talk. Assisted hearing sets are available.
