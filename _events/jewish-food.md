A talk with Julia Biggs, Independent Art Historian.

Today, Passover (or Pesach, as it is known in Hebrew) is the most widely observed of all the Jewish holidays and the Passover meal – the Seder - is the most practiced of all the Jewish rituals. This talk will explore the meaning behind the different foods eaten during the Passover feast, revealing how these dishes tell stories and embrace all five senses. From early modern illuminated Hebrew manuscripts that feature depictions of symbolic foods, to a ‘singing’ Seder plate, discover why Jews have always been so enthusiastic about food!

Admission is by token, one per person, available at the Courtyard Entrance desk on a first-come first-served basis 30 minutes before the talk. Assisted hearing sets are available.
