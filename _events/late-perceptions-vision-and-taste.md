**Cancelled due to C-19 Pandemic**

See four exhibitions after-hours: Feast & Fast, Inspire, Sharpening Perceptions and Virtue, Vice & the Senses, and enjoy them through a series of pop-up talks and events.

Also witness culinary and theatrical experiment with a performance of Food and Feuds: Two cooks of Hexham, written by Fiona Ellis (in Grove Lodge Rooms at 17.30 & 19.45). Delving into the life of Hexham's Hannah Glasse (considered by many to be the first domestic goddess) this imaginary time travelling experience, designed to appeal to all five senses, brings Glasse, Ann Cook (Glasse’s sworn enemy and rival) and Isabella Beeton together to cook whilst they talk about their hopes and dreams from conflict to sisterhood. You even get to leave with a gingerbread biscuit gift!
£25 (£20 concessions). BOOKING ESSENTIAL visit: Cambridge Live Tickets or tel: 01223 357851.
