A talk with Dr Helen Pfeifer, Faculty of History.

In the Ottoman Empire as in our own society, food acted not only as a source of nourishment but as a tool for expressing identity and social status. This talk will look at how dining practices in the Middle East during the sixteenth and seventeenth-century formed a basis of religion and class distinctions.

Admission is by token, one per person, available at the Courtyard Entrance desk on a first-come first-served basis 30 minutes before the talk. Assisted hearing sets are available.
