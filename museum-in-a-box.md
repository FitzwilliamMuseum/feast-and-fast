**To be filled with pictures of the work and install of the box when done.**

The intended outcome of this strand of the CEEF fellowship is to ‘send the Fitz, in bits’—i.e. to post small themed collections of 3D printed objects and paper materials for consumers to use with a ‘Brain Box’ from Museum in a Box. Through sending these low-cost collections to audiences with minimal access to wider cultural provision, we could drastically increase the reach of the museum’s collections as well as attract new and more diverse audiences to the museum itself.

In the first instance, we will be running pilot schemes in clinical settings and with disadvantaged communities in rural Cambridgeshire. The first prototype collection will be themed around this exhibition.

The [Museum-in-a-Box](https://creative-economy.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/) collaborative part of this project was funded under grant AH/S012583/1 part of the Development Grants Scheme. It starts on January 1st 2019 and finishes on December 31st 2019.
