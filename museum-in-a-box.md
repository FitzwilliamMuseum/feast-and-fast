In the creative zone of the exhibition, our AHRC funded fellow Dr Abi L Glen, has installed her postdoctoral collaborative work with Museum in a Box and Cambridge Art Makers. Two Raspberry Pi powered boxes (and soon to be three) are available for visitors to interact with and three framed prints of an artistic representation of Wisbech Museum's Swan Register.

The boxes are linked via small microchips (NFC - near field communication- stickers) to digital audio files, and these are activated when a 3d printed object or card with a sticker attached is placed on the box's reader.
