Food defines us as individuals, communities, and nations: we are what we eat and,
equally, what we don’t eat. When, where, why, how and with whom we eat are crucial
to our identity. Feast & Fast presents novel approaches to understanding the
history and culture of food and eating.

This research‐led multi-sensory exhibition will showcase hidden and newly‐conserved
treasures from the Fitzwilliam and other collections, and features four spectacular
historical reconstructions with food at their centre, including a Jacobean sugar
banquet, a European feasting table and a Georgian confectioner’s workshop. It will
tease out many contemporary and controversial issues – such as the origins of food
and food security, over consumption in times of austerity, and our relationship with
animals and nature – thereby linking the past with our present, and encouraging
 visitors to question and rethink our relationship with food.

To complement Feast & Fast, a flamboyant 4-metre tall pineapple installation
specially-commissioned from Bompas and Parr - experts in multi-sensory experience
design - will be displayed on the Museum’s front lawn for the duration of the
exhibition and illuminated at night.
