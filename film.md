title: Feast and Fast, the films
---

Feast & Fast tells the stories of people in early modern Europe coming together to produce, prepare, and consume food. The Fitzwilliam Museum asked three groups of people who regularly take part in activities at the museum to help us bring the story up-to-date by sharing their memories and experiences.

Working with Egg & Spoon Films and the exhibition curators, the groups enjoyed handling museum objects included in the exhibition and sharing food-related objects from their own homes, and the memories associated with them.

From favourite recipe books to well-loved aprons handed down from relatives who worked in service, the objects provoked rich and varied reflections. Each of the groups then invited the filmmakers to share a meal with them and continue the conversation.

We hope the film encourages you to reflect on your own memories of coming together over food.
