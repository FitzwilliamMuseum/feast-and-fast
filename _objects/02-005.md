Parker’s great standing cup is the second grandest in Cambridge (after the Vice- Chancellor’s Cup of 1592) and one of the most significant examples of an English standing cup of its date anywhere. It is a triumph  of technical virtuosity with some elements separately cast and soldered on. While some standing cups were for display only, this one was almost certainly meant to be used since the cup is made in two parts: the bowl is a push-fit into the base, and its interior has been deliberately smoothed over to make it easier to wash up.
