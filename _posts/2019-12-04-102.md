This colourful beadwork purse acted as a reminder of the importance of charity and a public expression of piety, clearly expressed by the 2019-12-04-s, ‘REMEMBER THE POORE’.  Every time the owner dipped her gloved hand inside to remove a coin, she would see this instruction.  England, 1631  Satin, leather lining, silk thread, cord and polychrome glass beads  

Given by Miss Whitehurst (T.1-1836)
