Thomas Powell’s halfpenny token is decorated with nine lozenges in a diamond formation, probably representing a stylised plaited loaf.  Since this device appears on other tokens where the issuer describes himself as a baker, it is likely that this was also the trade of the 22-year-old Powell who lived in the parish of St Clement’s, Cambridge.  

Issued by Thomas Powell, Cambridge, England, 1666
