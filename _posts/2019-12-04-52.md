Enlarged reproduction of the Porta dedicata alla Vigilanza, from Francesco Orilia, Il zodiaco, over, idea di perfettione di prencipi (Ottavio Beltrano: Naples, 1630), fol. 456  The cuccagna originated in the ‘Land of Cockaigne’, an imaginary place of plenty in which food rained from the skies and all the bodily needs were met. The cuccagna was in part a political tool that allowed rulers to show their liberality and munificence in a very public way.  These kinds of festivities contributed to the creation of powerful civic and religious identities mediated through food, and to  powerful collective and individual memories for participants and spectators alike. The cuccagna demonstrates the diverse uses and multiple meanings of food and its imaginary possibilities in the lives of early modern Europeans.
