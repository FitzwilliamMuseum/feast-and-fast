Double-sided gingerbread mould with King William III (front)  and Queen Mary II (back)  Double-sided gingerbread moulds with a man carved into one side and a woman into the other are common. The English sugar banquet table at the start of the exhibition includes  a pair of fashionably dressed gingerbread musicians in the form of a male harpist and a female lutenist, pressed from an exceptionally well-carved, double-sided, boxwood mould.  This remarkable English mould – one of the largest of its time in existence – has portraits of William III and Mary II of England, likely made in c.1689 to produce gingerbread likenesses to celebrate their coronation.
