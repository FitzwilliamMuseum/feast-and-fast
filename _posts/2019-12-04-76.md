Ginger jar and domed cover with putti amongst foliage  Although the purpose of Chinese porcelain ‘ginger jars’ remains unclear, their bulbous shape became very fashionable in Europe.  Imitations were made in silver during the seventeenth century, such as this one made by the London-based German silversmith, Jacob Bodendeich, and in hard- or soft-paste porcelain in the eighteenth century, purely for decoration.
