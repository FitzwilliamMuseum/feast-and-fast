Landscape with shepherds  This large canvas portrays an idyllic pastoral scene of prosperous country life with shepherds tending a mixed flock at early dawn, with fruit-laden trees at right, and a majestic mountain range in the distance. With its timeless feel and gentle pace, Bassano’s painting can be interpreted as a Renaissance Arcadia, with man living in complete harmony with nature. Although the serenity belies the hard physical work of shepherding, several details shed light on animal husbandry in mountainous regions. A shepherd-boy checks the fresh spring water that his lamb is about to drink, while his kneeling companion, surrounded by large wooden milk-tubs, appears to be in the process of milking his ewes.
