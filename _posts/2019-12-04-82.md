Double-sided gingerbread mould with militiaman (front) and woman (back)  Especially popular in northern Europe, gingerbread was made with both ginger and sugar. It was usually pressed in the shape of a figure or animal, using wooden moulds.  These were often double-sided to save wood and also space in the kitchen. This example has a pike-holding militiaman on one side, and a fashionably dressed woman on the other, but carved into the block upside down.  The resulting gingerbread militiaman is identical  to that depicted in van Mierisâ€™ Market stall (displayed to the left). The fact that this was painted over a century later proves the  popularity of certain motifs, passed down from generation to generation.
