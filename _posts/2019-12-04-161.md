And by their Order Published;  By George Lord Bishop of Chester  (London, 1666)  When facing great trials, such as famine, plagues or war, communities often undertook collective fasts to seek God’s mercy.  When London was ravaged by bubonic plague in spring 1665, a Royal proclamation declared that a day of fasting be observed on 12 July 1665 and on the first Wednesday of every month thereafter. This ‘Fast-Sermon’ was delivered to MPs on the official plague fasting day for October 1666.
