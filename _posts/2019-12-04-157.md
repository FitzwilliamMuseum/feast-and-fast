Although many images displayed in this room reflect the dark connotations of food as a dangerous gateway to iniquity, eating played a vital role in the drama of Christian redemption. This devotional plaque shows The Last Supper, Jesus’ final meal before he was crucified,  when he commanded his disciples to eat and  drink in remembrance of him. The ritual re- enactment of this holy meal – the Eucharist or Holy Communion – became the central act of Christian worship, when the body and blood of Christ (in the form of bread and wine) were consumed for spiritual nourishment.
