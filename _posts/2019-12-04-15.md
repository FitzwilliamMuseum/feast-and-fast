Libro de dissegni per far vasella di argento et oro per servitio della credenza e tavola  

These drawings are early copies of original designs by Giulio Romano, an architect and designer who worked for the Gonzaga court in Mantua, northern Italy. The designs are for the sorts of objects deemed essential for his patrons’ table ‘all made in the antique manner, and as are used today in Rome for the table of the Pope and cardinals and other noble lords’: salts, pepper-pots, drinking vessels, carafes, candlesticks, ewers and basins.  No exact copies in gold or silver are known  to exist for any of these designs. Most reflect the splendour, ingenuity, and complexity of the table decorations that once graced courtly tables, which would have challenged even the most skilled craftsmen.  

‘Designs for making vessels in silver and gold for service from the sideboard  and for the table’
