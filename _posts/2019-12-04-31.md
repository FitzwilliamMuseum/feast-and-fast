Summer with Ceres, from The Four Seasons  Our 2019-12-04- ‘cereal’ derives from Ceres, goddess of agriculture, who personifies Summer. She rests on a wheat sheaf under the shade of a fruiting tree, a sickle in hand, while keeping  a careful eye on the harvesting scene below. Some labourers cut the wheat while others stack it onto a horse-drawn cart, and rake up the gleanings to ensure no waste. In a field higher up, sheep shearing takes place. Around Ceres’ feet luscious ripe fruits and vegetables are strewn. The Zodiac signs that hold sway over the summer months – Cancer, Leo, and Virgo – are shown overhead, but again in reverse order.
