Taste and Hearing are here combined.  An elegant couple sits at a dessert table laden with sugar confectionery and succulent fruit.  Musical instruments and scores share the spotlight with these earthly delights.  The man strums a lute while looking lovingly at his consort, who has put her viol down to return his gaze. In the background, a man picks fruit while couples dance and have amorous liaisons. The Latin verse at the bottom  describes Mother Earth’s generosity in contrast  to the music-making couple’s overindulgence in food and drink and their implied lustful relationship.

Crispijn I de Passe (1564 –1637), after Maarten de Vos (1532 – 1603) Netherlands, 1613
