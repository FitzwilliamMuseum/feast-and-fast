Enlarged reproduction of the Porta dedicata alla Vigilanza, from Francesco Orilia, Il zodiaco, over, idea di perfettione di prencipi (Ottavio Beltrano: Naples, 1630), fol. 456  This spectacular life-size cuccagna arch is based on a small woodcut published in 1630. It recreates a multi-sensory triumphal arch erected in Naples in June 1629 as part of the celebrations to commemorate the Duke of Albaâ€™s 7-year tenure as Viceroy. The original wood and canvas arch was completely covered  in food: stacked wheels of cheese and loaves of  bread, cured ham hocks, salami, and local pear- shaped cheeses called caciocavallo. Two suckling pigs had tubes wedged in their mouths from which fireworks were lit.  Cuccagne were meant for the stomach as well as the eyes. At a certain point, hungry  Neapolitans were permitted to dismantle these edible displays, watched over by their rulers, local nobility, and tourists, and to take any remaining foodstuffs home.
