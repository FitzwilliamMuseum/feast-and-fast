One-handled honey pot with three hounds chasing a hare.  

This late seventeenth-century honey pot would, originally, have had a ceramic lid to keep dust and insects out. It is a rare survival as they were easily broken, which explains why many were made in wood. Honey was used for remedies for jaundice, worms, and piles and in recipes for gingerbread and mead.  

Staffordshire, England, c.1670 â€“1700

Lead-glazed, slip-trailed earthenware  

Dr J.W.L. Glaisher Bequest (C.231-1928)
