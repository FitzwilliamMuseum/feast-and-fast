This exquisitely illuminated Book of Hours was designed to aid private prayer and this page lists saints’ days between May and August.  The Labours of the Months appear at the top of the pages, alternating with the relevant Zodiac sign. On the left, May shows falconry, followed by Gemini; June shows the hay harvest, followed by Cancer. On the right,  July shows the wheat harvest, followed by Leo,  while August shows wheat threshing, followed by Virgo. At the sides, and at the bottom, vignettes show episodes from The Creation: God creates Adam and Eve and explains that they can eat any fruit in the Garden of Eden, except for that on the Tree of Knowledge, which is forbidden. The combination of pagan and Christian motifs would not have been problematic to its readers since Mother Nature’s ability to provide food was seen as part of a divine order.
