The Feast of Herod  Most likely made as a wedding present to decorate a new marital home, the brutality and sordid aspects of the blood-chilling story of Herod's feast have been marginalised to leave a scene of multi-sensory feasting.  Herod and his new wife are seated behind a  table laden with pyramidal food compositions and various heaped platters; a servant carries in an ornate pie. Bottom right, Salome holds a platter with the head of John the Baptist, who was executed for having criticised the incest of Herod, reminding viewers of the dangers of food, greed, and sexual lust.
