This ewer is decorated with four oval medallions containing female personifications of Faith, Hope, and Charity (the three Theological Virtues) and Fortitude (one of the four Cardinal Virtues). They were presumably included as moral exemplars to diners and intended to provoke ‘virtuous’ discussions.  The rest of the ewer has less high-brow  decoration relating, appropriately, both to water and food in the form of water-fowl and ripe fruit.
