A lady holding a plate with a waffle

In this erotically-charged image, a beautiful young woman in a low-cut dress offers the viewer a waffle presented on a polished silver plate. With a knife in her other hand, she is ready to cut the luxurious sweet food into pieces for sharing as a prelude to more carnal delights. Schalcken has used food to evoke the sweet pleasures of an imagined late-night encounter. While Christian moralists warned of the sinful nature of over-indulgence in bodily pleasures, such highly popular sensual depictions of food and flesh were designed to stimulate both physical and sexual appetites.
