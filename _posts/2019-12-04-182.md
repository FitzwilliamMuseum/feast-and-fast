Porringers are small bowls for eating porridge or gruel, often used to feed the sick or elderly. They usually have one or two handles and were made in a range of materials. This Dutch Delftware example is unusual because it also has a short spout and cover. This suggests  that it may have been made to serve posset,  a comforting beverage made from hot cream frothed up with egg yolk, alcohol, sugar, and spices. A common remedy for the sick in early modern Europe, posset was served from pots with long spouts to suck out the alcohol, two handles to ensure a steady grip, and a cover to keep the contents warm.
