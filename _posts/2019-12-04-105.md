Robert Millard was a baker based in Caxton in the second half of the seventeenth century. His halfpenny token proudly declares his name and profession in elegant capital letters encircling a beautifully decorated round pie crust. Following Millard’s death in 1718, an inventory of his bakehouse-cum-home listed not only a well-stocked kitchen but also a separate baking room with various equipment including pots, pans, dishes, sieves, a dough stand, and a cheese stand.
