Chapter 10: The Angel gives St John the book to eat, from The Apocalypse  Commonly known as The Apocalypse, this final book in the Bible was widely believed to prophesy the events leading to the end of the world. Here Duvet depicts the seemingly  bizarre episode when St John is instructed by a voice from heaven to consume a book given  him by an angel: ‘And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter’ (Revelation 10:  8-10).

Jean Duvet (1485 – 1561)  

France, c.1561
