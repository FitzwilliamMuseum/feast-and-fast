Holding two-thirds of an English pint, this ‘gylt pott’ was given by Parker to Caius on New Year’s Day 1572, the same day he gave an identical one to Trinity Hall, and a slightly more elaborate one (made in 1571) to Corpus.  These were Parker’s final lifetime gifts and are  amongst the earliest tall tankards in existence. Such large tankards remained fashionable until the 1630s, when they were replaced by smaller ones that were easier to handle.
