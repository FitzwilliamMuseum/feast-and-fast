Tureen and cover in the form of a rabbit  Ceramic tableware in the form of edible animals, vegetables, and fruit was made for display and use. When placed on the dining table, it was intended to deceive, surprise, and amuse diners. Tureens like this were normally used for soup, served during the first course at dinner (the meal served in the middle of the day). While this tureen could have held rabbit soup, it could equally have been filled with another soup, for example, pea soup, which – to judge from the large number of published  recipes – was one of the most popular soups in  England at this time.
