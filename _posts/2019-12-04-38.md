Phlegmatici  (The Phlegmatic Temperament) from The Four Temperaments  Luna, goddess of the moon and regarded as a moistening celestial planet, rules over her Phlegmatic people. She is shown in the  company of the three ‘water’ signs – Cancer, Pisces, and Scorpio. Below, her Phlegmatic subjects fish with lines, nets, and traps,  whilst others hunt water fowl including swans, geese, and ducks. The Latin inscription at  the bottom was supplied by Heemskerck’s doctor friend Hadrianus Junius, who was aware of the significance of the Humours related  to diet. Interestingly, this is the only one of Heemskerck’s Four Temperaments to include food-gathering activities.
