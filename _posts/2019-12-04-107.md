The inscription on Hugh Conny’s token reveals that he operated in Caxton and Elsworth, neighbouring villages 9 miles west of Cambridge. The design of three rabbits, or coneys, is a play on his surname, but whether he actually traded in rabbits is unknown.  Conny may have known Robert Millard, a baker  based in Caxton, whose token with a pie crust is displayed nearby.  

Issued by Hugh Conny, Caxton, Cambridgeshire, England, 1666
