Bartolomeo Scappi, Opera (Venice, 1570)  This first edition of Bartolomeo Scappi’s Opera was given to the University by George I. Scappi was an early celebrity chef, whose credentials as personal cook to Pope Pius V are proudly announced on the title-  page, which also includes his portrait. Scappi’s  manual falls within the genre of ‘how-to’ books in which expert knowledge of cooking and serving of food was disseminated to professionals as well as interested amateurs. It is the first cookbook with abundant high- quality illustrations of kitchens, cooking  equipment, and dining. This fold-out illustration  shows the correct etiquette of serving a grand banquet.
