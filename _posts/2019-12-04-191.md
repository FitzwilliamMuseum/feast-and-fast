A bundle of asparagus  Obsessed with asparagus, Coorte portrayed bundles of this expensive but locally grown delicacy many times. Using various artistic devices (dramatic spot lighting, plain dark background, forward placement), he creates a brilliant illusion of reality and elevates his  humble and unusual subject to high art. Anglo-  Welsh painter Frank Brangwyn loved the sensual qualities of Dutch still lifes: ‘A flower, a melon, all things are sensual [...] And to a true painter, these things move one, they do something which urges [and] excites one to paint [...] The joy of squeezing out of the tube a bit of juicy yellow or green [...] All this is what I call sensual.’

Adriaen Coorte (1659/64 –1707)  

Middelburg, Netherlands, 1703 Oil on canvas  

Given by Frank Brangwyn, 1943 (2575)
