Preparations for a feast  This painting shows a wealthy Dutch merchant’s kitchen with a cook prepping for a feast. She is ‘larding’ a skinned hare by sewing strips of lard into its back to prevent it from drying out when roasted. Behind the eggs, the cloven hoof of a deer or boar projects from the side of a spectacular pie; an entire leg has been crammed inside the pastry case. The herringbone pattern impressed on the pastry enclosing the leg was made using the  brass crimping tool lying near the lard, identical  to the English pastry jagger (displayed nearby).
