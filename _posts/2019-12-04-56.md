A plucked duck suspended by its neck and one leg  This partially suspended, live-plucked duck is a disturbing image of anger and suffering.  By excluding any background and making the duck fill the page, de Gheyn has intensified its pain and indignity. This makes for uncomfortable viewing – at least for modern eyes. Little is known about the practice of live-plucking in early modern Europe, or its relationship to food production, but a recipe for roasting a live-plucked duck or goose is  included in John Wecker’s 1660 Book of Secrets.  There were a few early modern writers, such as Thomas Tryon, an early advocate of  vegetarianism, who reflected on man’s violence against animals, both in hunting and farming.
