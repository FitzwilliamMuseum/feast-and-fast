Charter of free warren with the great seal of England, granted to Roger de Pilkington by Edward I  Food production and sourcing in early modern Europe were ultimately based on who had access to what and when. Long before 1500, hunting for wild game in England was a privilege granted by the monarch to favoured subjects.  In this rare charter of free warren dated 10  June 1291, Edward I grants the nobleman Roger de Pilkington and his heirs the right to hunt – or to ‘free warren’ – on his demesne lands. This deed is beautifully illustrated with hunting imagery: a crossbowman and various wild animals including a kingfisher, boar, wild cat, and deer. It also includes a cow and sheep, representing livestock, and a peacock.  

Norham (Northumberland), June 1291
