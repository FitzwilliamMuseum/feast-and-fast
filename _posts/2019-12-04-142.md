Pastry jagger with finial incorporating a heart design England, c.1730  Latten (alloy of copper and zinc)  Private collection  The 5 pastry tools displayed here in chronological order are made from different materials in strikingly different forms, at different times, and in different countries but they all performed the same function: to create striking edible ornamentation in raw pastry dough to embellish pies, such as those on  our recreated Baroque feasting table. English  examples often had a measuring spoon at one end, or a crimper for sealing pie edges, vital to stop the contents from bubbling out when being baked. The Dutch example is adorned with a pastry cook in formal guild dress with a sheet of pastry draped over his rolling pin.
