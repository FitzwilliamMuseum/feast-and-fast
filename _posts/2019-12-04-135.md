Edward Kidder, Receipts of Pastry and Cookery, For the Use of his Scholars (London, c.1720)  This highly popular book provides a record of the lessons that ‘pastry master’ Edward Kidder offered at his two cookery schools in London, where gentlewomen who wanted to increase their desirability in the marriage market could learn how to cook and bake. This publication enabled those who did not live in London,  or who could not afford the classes, to benefit  from his knowledge. It is illustrated with engraved patterns of designs for all manner of pasties and pies.
