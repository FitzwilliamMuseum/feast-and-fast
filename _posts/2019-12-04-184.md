The sick were sometimes able to feed themselves, with specially designed feeding cups such as this delicate German example, whose small scale and limited capacity show that it was intended for individual use.  These were easier to manage than posset pots  because, in addition to their carefully angled feeding spout, they also had an in-built half-lid. This combination of design features meant that the liquid nourishment could be poured inside the cup by the carer and easily sucked out by the invalid through the spout without the risk of spillage when the feeder was tipped forward.
