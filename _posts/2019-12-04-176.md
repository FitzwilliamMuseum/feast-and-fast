This colourful spouted pharmacy bottle was designed originally to contain a syrup made with fennel, as indicated by its label, ‘C[onfectio]. DE. FENOCHI’, meaning ‘decoction of fennel’, obtained by heating  or boiling the plant to extract its essence.  Fennel was often used as a diuretic for weight loss, and in a variety of remedies.  Probably Castel Durante, Le Marche, Italy,  c.1550–1600  

Tin-glazed and painted earthenware (maiolica)  

Given by Ernest Saville Peck (C.5-1952)
