slug: spitjack

In early modern Europe, meat was roasted over fire on spits rotated by clockwork jacks, like this wall-mounted example. It is similar to that shown fixed on the hearth in Pieter Aertsen’s Preparations for a feast (displayed at  right). Skewers were used to secure the carcass  onto the spit-shaft, so that meat and spit rotated together, guaranteeing an even cooking on all sides. This was highly desirable as Dean Swift in his ‘Receipt to Roast Mutton’ makes clear: ‘Let the jack go swiftly round,  Let me have it nicely browned’.
